    <div class="scrollable-cell">I was born in 1940 in Alexandria, Egypt. The second of seven children, to Eliaho and Sara Wakrat. We were a very wealthy family. My father had a fabric shop. During the summer holidays we traveled with my father's parents to our summer house in the coastal town of Abu Ir.</br>
    When I was 16 years old (in 1956) my parents decided to marry me. My husband Victor(Haim), who was 12 years older than me, was from Cairo. He came from a large family, as the eldest son who took care of the household and his younger brothers. We got married in the great synagogue in Alexandria called "אליהו הנביא".</br>
    A month later start to journy to Israel on a ship from Port Said. On the way we were detained in Cyprus for about three months together with my husband's whole family.</br>
    When we arrived Israel, some of my husband's brothers were already here. Therefore, when the goverment wanted to bring us to Moshav Yesha in the Gaza Strip, my brother-in-law, Aharon, made sure that we got a shed in the center of the country, near him in Holon.</br>
    The difficulty was great at first. 8 people lived in the shack - my husband, his mother, his brothers and me. We didn't understand the language, and at the grocery store they laughed at us and made us pay more.</br>
    Later, my husband and I were able to move to a shack in another neighborhood in Holon, just the two of us. There I gave birth to my two older daughters - Lea was born in 1960 and Sara was born in 1962. Later, they decided to vacate the sheds. We were offered to move to a one and a half rooms apartment on the fourth floor in the Jesssi Cohen neighborhood in Holon. Although the Dayan family, the committee of the sheds neighborhood, told us not to take the offer, because later we would be offered bigger apartment in better neighborhood, my father decided for us to move.</br>
    We had three more children in this apartment - Jacob (Jako) was born in 1964, Ofra was born in 1966 and Yechiel was born in 1970.</br>
    In September 1970, when my son Yechiel was three months old, I started working at "Israel Post".</br>
    In 1974 we moved to a larger apartment in Bat Yam, where my children grew up.</br>
    I was privileged to marry all my children, raise my dear grandchildren and even marry some of them, together with my husband, who died in August 2009 at the age of 81.
    Since then, I have been privileged to continue to see my grandchildren get married, and give birth to my great-grandchildren. Last year my great-grandson gave birth!

        <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center">My Mother - Sara</p>
        <p class="light_texts">My mother was, and still is, a very significant figure in my life.
          Her father came from a wealthy British family in Egypt. During his life he became blind, and when they were looking for a Jewish caregiver for him, they chose my mother's mother, who came by foot from Tunis to Egypt with her sister only. The two fell in love, and decided to marry despite the opposition of her father's family. Following their opposition, they decided to remove all financial support from the couple.</br>
          Therefore, my mother grew up as an only child in poverty and hardship. Luckily for her, her parents did not give up on her education, and she was able to attend an English school in Egypt and received a good education.</br>
          She knew my father since childhood, and despite the class gap between them, they decided to get married and had 7 children.</br>
          About two years after I immigrated to Israel with my husband and his family (in 1960), my mother heard about my difficulty and decided to come too. Despite my father's opposition, and with 3 children under the age of 10. She left the wealth that was in Egypt, and came to Israel to support me, and the family I started to build here.</br>
          My mother was a woman who appreciated beauty and aesthetics. Even in the difficult conditions after they immigrated to Israel, she always made sure to be well-groomed and look her best. In my opinion, this is something I learned from her and accompanies me all my life.</br>
          She was a warm woman, who always took care of her family, cooked and spiled us. I want to believe that I resemble her in these areas as well.<br/>
          A few words from me, Liron as editor:<br/>
          I find some points of similarity between my grandmother and her mother or as we call her - Nonna Sarah.
          In the first years of marriage, Nonna Sarah lived in her husband's family home, people who looked down on her because of her socioeconomic background, and made it very difficult for her. My grandmother Miriam (Savta Mimi), also spent the first years of her marriage in one house together with her mother-in-law, and her husband's younger siblings. My grandmother, who came from Alexandria, great wealth, an open and modern worldview, had to accept her mother-in-law's way of life. Her mother-in-law came from Cairo, from a Jewish slum that suffered Muslim hostility, so she guarded her daughters and restricted them greatly.<br/>
          This similarity made Nonna Sarah understand my grandmother, support her. And yes, for my grandmother to appreciate her mother and what she went through in life.<br/>
          Additionally, unfortunately, my grandmother and my great-grandmother both experienced the loss of a child.<br/>
          Nonna Sara lost her daughter Rosa, who had a serious heart disease and died after her son's birth. And my grandmother, lost my dear uncle Jako after his battle with lung cancer.<br/>
          I am sure that the fact that my grandmother saw her mother go through the same experience, left a mark on her and somehow changed her view and coping with this difficult experience. And again, made her appreciate in retrospect the difficulties her mother faced, and her behavior following them and perhaps despite them.
